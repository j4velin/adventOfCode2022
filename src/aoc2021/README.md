Welcome to the Advent of Code[^aoc] Kotlin project created by [j4velin][github] using the [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] delivered by JetBrains.

In this repository, j4velin is about to provide solutions for the puzzles using [Kotlin][kotlin] language.

[^aoc]:
[Advent of Code][aoc] – an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provide any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.
